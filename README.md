# Java Online Quiz Application

Create a Java-based Online Quiz Application that leverages various Java features, including Query, Multithreading, Custom Exception Handling, Streams, and a Client-Server architecture. The project also includes a small frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with the Java backend.

## Key Features:

### User Authentication:

Users should be able to register and log in to the system. Implement password hashing for security.

### Quiz Management:

- Admins can create, edit, and delete quizzes.
- Each quiz has multiple-choice questions with options and correct answers.

### User Interface:

- Design a simple and intuitive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Include pages for user registration, login, quiz selection, and quiz taking.

### Client-Server Architecture:

- Implement a server using Java's Socket API to handle incoming requests.
- Establish a client-server protocol for communication.

### Multithreading:

- Use multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
- Handle each client connection in a separate thread to ensure concurrent access.

### Query and Database Interaction:

- Utilize a simple database (e.g., SQLite or H2) to store user data, quiz questions, and results.
- Implement SQL queries to fetch and update data as needed.

### Custom Exception Handling:

- Implement custom exceptions to handle specific error scenarios gracefully.
- Handle cases such as incorrect login credentials or attempts to access a nonexistent quiz.

### Streams for Data Processing:

- Use Java streams for efficient processing of data, especially when retrieving and processing quiz results.

### Scoring and Results:

- Calculate and display scores at the end of each quiz.
- Store and display historical quiz results for users.

### Security Considerations:

- Implement secure communication between the client and server.
- Validate user input to prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities.

## Project Structure:

### Client Side:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the frontend.
- Frontend communicates with the server using AJAX or Fetch API.

### Server Side:

- Main server class to handle incoming connections and manage client threads.
- DatabaseHandler class for database interactions.
- QuizManager class for quiz-related operations.
- UserAuthentication class for handling user registration and login.

## Technologies Used:

### Backend:

- Core Java for server-side logic.
- Socket API for client-server communication.
- JDBC for database connectivity.

### Frontend:

- HTML for structuring the web pages.
- CSS for styling the frontend.
- JavaScript for client-side interactions and making asynchronous requests.

## Development Steps:

1. **Database Setup:**

   - Design and create the database schema.
   - Set up tables for users, quizzes, questions, and results.

2. **Server Implementation:**

   - Create a server class to handle incoming connections.
   - Implement multithreading for concurrent client handling.
   - Set up a client-server protocol for communication.

3. **Database Interaction:**

   - Implement the DatabaseHandler class for CRUD operations.
   - Use JDBC to connect to the database.

4. **Quiz Management:**

   - Create and manage quizzes using the QuizManager class.
   - Store quiz-related data in the database.

5. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Securely store and validate user credentials.

6. **Frontend Development:**

   - Design HTML pages for user registration, login, quiz selection, and quiz taking.
   - Style the pages using CSS.
   - Use JavaScript for frontend interactions and AJAX/Fetch for server communication.

7. **Testing:**

   - Perform unit testing for individual components.
   - Test the application as a whole to ensure seamless integration.

8. **Documentation:**

   - Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the project.
   - Include instructions for setting up the environment and running the application.

By following these steps and incorporating the mentioned features, you can
develop a comprehensive Online Quiz Application using Java with a client-server
architecture and a simple yet effective frontend.
